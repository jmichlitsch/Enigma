# Enigma
#Self Assessment

Functionality = 3, got encrypt and decrypt working but didn't finish crack method for 4

OOP = 2.5, my engima class is much larger than the rest of my classees and my key class is very small but it was made to be properly tested by simplecov

Ruby Coverntion = 3, I believe I use proper indention and I do use a hash to get my letters into integers to properly use addition for both encrypt and decrypt

TDD = 3, From what I remember, I always started my tests first then writ my code to match my tests. I got 100% on my SimpleCov so I did test everyone of my methods
